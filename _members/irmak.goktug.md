I am an undergraduate dental student enrolled at King's College London, actively involved in collecting data for PhD students that are involved with the microbiome BioBank project. My current role entails assisting in the assessment of oral health conditions and collecting samples from patients who are either diagnosed with infective endocarditis or have high risk of developing the disease in the future. My particular interest lies in the field of oral medicine and special care dentistry, with aspirations to pursue a career in maxillofacial surgery.
