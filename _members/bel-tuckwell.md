I am a BSc Biomedical Science Graduate currently studying Dentistry at King's College London. 
My role within the team involves supporting the assessment of oral health among patients who are either at high risk of or have received a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. I assist in collecting biological samples from these patients in our specialised Perio-Cardio Clinic for the Microbiome BioBank project. Additionally, I am involved in generating and contributing to academic content derived from our research, with a specific emphasis on the dental aspect. I intend to pursue specialised training following my BDS degree, however, I have yet to determine the specific field or discipline I wish to focus on. In my spare time, I love running and playing Netball.
