Hello, I am Vanessa, a clinical academic and principal investigator in periodontology and implant dentistry at King’s College London. I practice clinically as a consultant periodontist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. I pursued general dentistry and specialist training across Mexico, Chile, the USA, and the UK.

I completed my PhD at the Eastman Dental Institute, UCL in 2016. Subsequently, I undertook roles as a Post-doctoral Researcher, Clinical Research Fellow, and then, an NIHR Clinical Lecturer. My clinical and research journey has led me through training experiences at institutions such as University College London, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, and Forsyth Institute, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, broadening my international expertise in both areas.

Our group is dedicated to exploring the complex dynamics of host-microbe interactions and their implications for periodontal and peri-implant health. We are particularly focused on understanding the broader systemic effects of these interactions, especially their impact on cardiovascular health.

We strongly believe in the power of collaboration and the innovation that stems from diverse perspectives. If you're a student excited about these research areas, an academic seeking collaboration, or someone passionate about advancing healthcare, we would love to hear from you. Please feel free to contact us.
