Since graduating from Kingâ€™s College London in 2016, I completed my Foundation Training in Kent Surrey and Sussex (East) and went on to complete Dental Core Training posts in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the William Harvey Hospital and Restorative Dentistry at Cardiff University Dental Hospital.

I am now completing my MClinDent in Periodontology at Guy's Hospital with my research being focused on the microbiome in Peri-Implantitis, working as part of Dr Sousa's fantastic team. 

Outside of clinical practice my greatest passions are in history and philosophy, as well as paddle-boarding around the beautiful Kentish canals and coastline.
